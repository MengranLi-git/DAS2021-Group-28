Data <- read.csv("dataset28.csv")
# The whole data set has 7 factors and 2000 observations.
# The explanatory variables are:
# country – Country of origin
# price – The cost for a bottle of wine
# province – The province or state the wine is from
# title – The title of the wine review
# variety – The type of grape
# winery – The winery that made the wine
# the response variable y is points – The number of points awarded for the wine on a scale of 1-100 (although reviewsare only posted for ratings 80 and above)
